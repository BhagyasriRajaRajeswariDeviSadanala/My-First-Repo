Devops:
Deveops=Development + Operations
It's a culture+ set of practices+ntools that help
Developers(who write the code)
Operations(who deploy/manage systems)
Work together, instead of working in silos.
Real-time  Example:
Without devops : Developer gives code to Ops team, they manually deploy, bugs happen, delays.
With devops : Code is automatically tested and deployed. customers get updates faster and safely. 
Devops helps you:
Release features faster
Fix bugs quickly
Automate repetitive tasks

Devops Lifecycle:
Plan:Define what to build
Develop:Write the code
Build:Compile code into deployable format
Test:Check for bugs automatically
Release:Approve the build for deployment.
Operate:Keep app running, fix any issues
Monitor:Analyze performance and feedback.
